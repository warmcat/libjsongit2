 *
 * You run it from the commandline with a fake "url", against a bare git dir,
 * and it spits out the corresponding JSON.  You use it like this
 *
 *  - repo base dir
 *  - "url" part to give the library
 *
 * This example just sets the virtual url part to "/git", this is pass in the
 * json to whatever will create links.  The "/git" part is snipped before
 * passing it to the library.
